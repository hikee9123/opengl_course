# Physics-Based Rendering

---

## Theory

- microfacet model
- energy conservation
- reflectance equation
- BRDF
- Authring PBR materials

---

## Lighting

- PBR surface model
- Textured PBR

---

## Diffuse Irradiance

- PBR and HDR
- Cubemap convolution
- PBR and indirect irradiance lighting

---

## Specular IBL

- pre-filtering HDR environment map
- pre-filter convolution artifacts
- pre-computing BRDF
- completing IBL reflectance
